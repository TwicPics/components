### What is TwicPics?

[TwicPics](https://www.twicpics.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=components) is a **Responsive Media Service Solution** (SaaS) that enables **on-demand responsive image & video generation**.

With TwicPics, developers only deal with high-resolution versions of their media while end-users receive **optimized, perfectly sized, device-adapted** versions **delivered from a server close to them**.

TwicPics acts as a **proxy**. It retrieves your master file — from your web server, cloud storage, or DAM — and generates a **device-adapted** version with **best-in-class compression**, delivered directly to the end-user from the **closest available delivery point**.

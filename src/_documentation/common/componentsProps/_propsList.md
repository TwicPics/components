__twicImg__twicPicture__| `alt` | `alt` attribute content | `String` | |
__twicImg__twicVideo__| `anchor` | Positions the __TWIC_SCOPE__ in both `contain` and `cover` mode. Accepted values are `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right` and `center`. `position` and `focus` take precedence in `contain` and `cover` mode respectively. Please note that `anchor` is applied **after** an eventual `preTransform`. When using `refit` in `cover` mode, `anchor` aligns the main object(s) with the given border side. | `String` | |
__twicPicture__| `anchor` | Positions the image in both `contain` and `cover` mode. Accepted values are `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right` and `center`. `position` and `focus` take precedence in `contain` and `cover` mode respectively. Please note that `anchor` is applied **after** an eventual `preTransform`. [Can be set at different breakpoints](#art-direction). | `String` |

__twicVideo__| `duration` | Limits the duration of the video. `duration` is expressed in seconds and must be a positive number. `duration` will not move the starting point of the video: to do so, you'll have to use the `from` property. See [duration documentation](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/reference/transformations#duration). | `String or number` | |
__twicImg__twicVideo__| `eager` | Load the __TWIC_SCOPE__ as soon as the component is mounted. This effectively means disabling lazy loading for this __TWIC_SCOPE__. | `boolean` | `false` |
__twicPicture__| `eager` | Load the __TWIC_SCOPE__ as soon as the `picture` element is processed and set `fetchpriority` to `high`. This effectively means disabling lazy loading for this image. Recommended for optimal Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) display. | `boolean` | `false` |
__twicPicture__| `fetchpriority` | Acts as standard [fetchpriority property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/fetchPriority). Can be `high`, `low`or `auto`. Defaults to `high` when `eager` is true. | `string` | |
__twicImg__twicVideo__| `focus` | Sets the focus point in `cover` mode. `focus` takes precedence over `anchor` when both are provided. See the [TwicPics focus attribute documentation](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/reference/native-attributes#data-twic-focus) for more information.

__twicPicture__| `focus` | Sets the focus point in `cover` mode. `focus` takes precedence over `anchor` when both are provided. See the [TwicPics focus attribute documentation](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/reference/native-attributes#data-twic-focus) for more information. Only use this attribute if you need a specific focus point or if you want to leverage smart cropping with `focus="auto"`: if you only need border-based positionning (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, etc), use `anchor` instead. [Can be set at different breakpoints](#art-direction). | `String` | |
__twicVideo__| `from` | Moves the starting point of the video. `from` is expressed in seconds and must be a positive number. `from` will not move the end point of the video: to do so, you'll have to use the `duration` or `to` properties. See from documentation. See [from documentation](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/reference/transformations#from). | `String or number` | |
`id` | Specifies a unique `id` for the __TWIC_SCOPE__. See [`global attribute id`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id). | `String` | |
__twicImg__twicVideo__| `intrinsic` | Dimensions in pixels of the **original** __TWIC_SCOPE__, formatted `<width>x<height>` (eg. 1920x1080). It prevents __TWIC_SCOPE__ upscaling and limits the number of generated variants. If using `preTransform`, you should specify the intrinsic dimensions of the **resulting** __TWIC_SCOPE__. Using incorrect values can lead to display issues, see the [intrinsic attribute documentation](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/reference/native-attributes#data-twic-intrinsic).| `String` | |
__twicImg__twicVideo__| `mode` | Can be `contain` or `cover` and determines if the __TWIC_SCOPE__ fills the area and is cropped accordingly (`cover`) or if the __TWIC_SCOPE__ will sit inside the area with no cropping (`contain`). | `String` | `cover` |
__twicPicture__| `mode` | Can be `contain` or `cover` and determines if the __TWIC_SCOPE__ fills the area and is cropped accordingly (`cover`) or if the __TWIC_SCOPE__ will sit inside the area with no cropping (`contain`). [Can be set at different breakpoints](#art-direction). | `String` | `cover` |
__twicImg__twicVideo__| `placeholder` | Can be `preview`, `meancolor`, `maincolor` or `none`.

__twicImg__twicVideo__| `position` | Positions the __TWIC_SCOPE__ in `contain` mode. `position` takes precedence over `anchor` when both are provided. Syntax is the same as for CSS position properties [`background-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) and [`object-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position). Only use this attribute if you need precise positionning: if you only need border-based positionning (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, etc), use `anchor` instead. | `String` | `center` |
__twicPicture__| `position` | Positions the __TWIC_SCOPE__ in `contain` mode. `position` takes precedence over `anchor` when both are provided. Accepted values are `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right` and `center`. [Can be set at different breakpoints](#art-direction). | `String` | `center` |
__twicVideo__| `posterFrom` | Determines which frame of the source video should be used as a poster / preview. `posterFrom` is expressed in seconds and must be a positive number. By default `posterFrom` is equal to 0, meaning the very first frame of the video is used. `posterFrom` will not modify the video in any way: to do so, you'll have to use the `duration`, `from` or `to` properties. | `String or number` | |
__twicImg__twicVideo__| `preTransform` | A slash-separated list of [TwicPics API transformations](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/reference/transformations) to be performed before resizing the __TWIC_SCOPE__ (see the [TwicPics Manipulation documentation](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/reference/transformations)). Note that `anchor` and `focus` are applied **after** `preTransform`: if you need to specify a specific focus point for your `preTransform` then it needs to be part of the expression (like `preTransform="focus=auto/crop=50px50p"` for instance). Be aware that using this option can lead to unexpected results so use with caution! | `String` | |

__twicImg__twicVideo__| `ratio` | A unitless `width/height` or `width:height` value pair (as in `4/3` or `4:3`) that defines the aspect ratio of the display area. If `height` is not specified, it is assumed to be `1`. A square area will be created by default. When set to `none`, ratio is determined based on width and height as computed by the browser following your `CSS` definitions. The `--twic-ratio` CSS variable is ignored in this instance. You are responsible for properly sizing the component when `ratio="none"`. | `String or number` | `1` |
__twicPicture__| `ratio` | A unitless `width/height` or `width:height` value pair (as in `4/3` or `4:3`) that defines the aspect ratio of the display area. If `height` is not specified, it is assumed to be `1`. A square area will be created by default. When set to `none`, the image is displayed with its intrinsic aspect ratio. In this case, you are responsible for optimizing the Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). [Can be set at different breakpoints](#art-direction). | `String or number` | `1` |
__twicImg__twicPicture__| `referrerpolicy` | Specifies the [referrer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) to use when fetching the image.

__twicImg__twicVideo__| `src` | Path to the __TWIC_SCOPE__. When not provided, a red lightweight `svg` [placeholder](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/reference/placeholders) that displays its intrinsic dimensions is displayed in place of the absent __TWIC_SCOPE__. When [env](#setup-options) is set to `offline`, that red lightweight `svg` is replaced by a simple red placeholder. | `String` | |__TWIC_STATE_CHANGE__
__twicPicture__| `sizes` | Specifies the layout width of the image for each breakpoints using media query syntax. The value of this parameter has a significant impact on performance.

| Attribute | Description | Type | Default |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
__twicImg__| `alt` | `alt` attribute content | `String` | based on `src` |
__twicImg__twicVideo__| `anchor` | Positions the __TWIC_SCOPE__ in both `contain` and `cover` mode. Accepted values are `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right` and `center`. `position` and `focus` take precedence in `contain` and `cover` mode respectively. Please note that `anchor` is applied __after__ an eventual `preTransform`. | `String` |
| `bot` | A slash-separated list of [TwicPics API transformations](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/api/transformations) to be performed for search engine bots. This overrides all other transformations when provided, even if empty (i.e `bot=""`). See the [TwicPics bot attribute documentation](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/script/attributes#data-twic-bot) for more information. | `String` | |
__twicImg__twicVideo__| `eager` | Load the __TWIC_SCOPE__ as soon as the component is mounted. This effectively means disabling lazy loading for this __TWIC_SCOPE__.  | `boolean` | `false` |
| `focus` | Sets the focus point in `cover` mode. `focus` takes precedence over `anchor` when both are provided. See the [TwicPics focus attribute documentation](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/script/attributes#data-twic-focus) for more information. Only use this attribute if you need a specific focus point or if you want to leverage smart cropping with `focus="auto"`: if you only need border-based positionning (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, etc), use `anchor` instead. | `String` | |__TWIC_ON_STATE_CHANGE_ASSET__
__twicImg__twicVideo__| `intrinsic` | Dimensions in pixels of the __original__ __TWIC_SCOPE__, formatted `<width>x<height>` (eg. 1920x1080). It prevents __TWIC_SCOPE__ upscaling and limits the number of generated variants. If using `preTransform`, you should specify the intrinsic dimensions of the __resulting__ __TWIC_SCOPE__. Using incorrect values can lead to display issues, see the [intrinsic attribute documentation](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/script/attributes#data-twic-intrinsic).| `String` | |
__twicImg__twicVideo__| `mode` | Can be `contain` or `cover` and determines if the __TWIC_SCOPE__ fills the area and is cropped accordingly (`cover`) or if the __TWIC_SCOPE__ will sit inside the area with no cropping (`contain`). | `String` | `cover` |
| `placeholder` | Can be `preview`, `meancolor`, `maincolor` or `none`. See the [TwicPics output transformation documentation](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/api/transformations#output) for more information. Setting will be overridden to `none` when using `zoom` `transition`. | `String` | `preview` |
| `position` | Positions the __TWIC_SCOPE__ in `contain` mode. `position` takes precedence over `anchor` when both are provided. Syntax is the same as for CSS position properties [`background-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) and [`object-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position). Only use this attribute if you need precise positionning: if you only need border-based positionning (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, etc), use `anchor` instead. | `String` | `center` |
__twicImg__twicVideo__| `preTransform` | A slash-separated list of [TwicPics API transformations](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/api/transformations) to be performed before resizing the __TWIC_SCOPE__ (see the [TwicPics Manipulation documentation](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/api/manipulations)). Note that `anchor` and `focus` are applied __after__ `preTransform`: if you need to specify a specific focus point for your `preTransform` then it needs to be part of the expression (like `preTransform="focus=auto/crop=50px50p"` for instance). Be aware that using this option can lead to unexpected results so use with caution! | `String` | |
| `ratio` | A unitless `width/height` or `width:height` value pair (as in `4/3` or `4:3`) that defines the aspect ratio of the display area. If `height` is not specified, it is assumed to be `1`. A square area will be created by default. When set to `none`, ratio is determined based on width and height as computed by the browser following your `CSS` definitions. The `--twic-ratio` CSS variable is ignored in this instance. You are responsible for properly sizing the component when `ratio="none"`. | `String | number` | `1` |
__twicImg__twicVideo__| `src` | Path to the __TWIC_SCOPE__. When not provided, a red lightweight `svg` [placeholder](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/api/placeholders) that displays its intrinsic dimensions is displayed in place of the absent __TWIC_SCOPE__. When [env](#setup-options) is set to `offline`, that red lightweight `svg` is replaced by a simple red placeholder. | `String` | |__TWIC_STATE_CHANGE__
| `step` | See the [TwicPics step attribute documentation](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/script/attributes#data-twic-step) for more information. | `Integer` | `10` |
__twicImg__twicVideo__| `transition` | Determines how the __TWIC_SCOPE__ will be revealed once loaded. With a fade in effect (`fade`), a zoom effect (`zoom`) or without any transition (`none`). Unsupported values are handled as `fade`. | `String` | `fade` |
| `transitionDuration` | Duration of the transition effect. | `String` | `400ms` |
| `transitionTimingFunction` | CSS timing function applied to the transition effect. | `String` | `ease` |
| `transitionDelay` | Transition delay of the transition effect. | `String` | `0ms` |
__twicImg__| `zoom` | Enables zoom feature and sets the magnification factor. Must be a number strictly greater than 1 as in `"1.5"` or `1.5`. When set to `CSS`, magnification factor is defined through the CSS variable `--twic-zoom`. | `String | number` | `1` |

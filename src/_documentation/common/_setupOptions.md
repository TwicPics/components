### Setup Options

| Option | Description | Type | Default |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| `anticipation` | [TwicPics](https://www.twicpics.com/) will lazy-load images by default. To avoid too abrupt a transition with elements appearing into view and then images very obviously loading afterwards, [TwicPics](https://www.twicpics.com/) will "anticipate" lazy loading by a factor of the actual viewport. This behavior is controlled by this setting. | `Number` | `0.2` |
| `debug` | When set to `true`, a gray lightweight `svg` [placeholder](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/api/placeholders) that displays its intrinsic dimensions is displayed in place of all medias targeted by their `src` value. Note that the preview function is then disabled. | `Boolean` | false |
| `domain` | This is your very own [TwicPics domain](https://www.twicpics.com/documentation/subdomain/). Providing it is __mandatory__. | `String` | |
| `maxDPR` | [TwicPics](https://www.twicpics.com/) will take the "Device Pixel Ratio" (`DPR`) of the current device into consideration when determining the sizes of images to load. By default, it will not take a `DPR` greater than `2` into consideration. If the `DPR` of the device is higher than `2`, [TwicPics](https://www.twicpics.com/) will assume it to be `2`. Using `maxDPR`, you can lower this limit down to `1` or be more permissive (for instance by setting it to `3` or `4`). | `Number` | `2` |
| `path` | Path to prepend to all src attributes. For instance, if path is `"some/folder"` then a src attribute set to `"image.jpg"` will be expanded into `"some/folder/image.jpg"` | `String` | |
| `step` | To avoid requesting too may variants of the same image, [TwicPics](https://www.twicpics.com/) will round the width of images to the closest multiple of step. The height will then be computed in order to respect the original aspect ratio. | `Integer` | `10` |
